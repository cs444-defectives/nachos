This directory contains the source files needed for Project 1.

These files have been modified from the original Nachos code.
They compile without warning on departmental Linux systems.

If you do a "make" with this source, you will find the nachos
binary in the threads subdirectory. If you execute that binary,
you should see the two ping-pong threads I demonstrated in class.
